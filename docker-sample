Application Architecture

docker-pets can be run as a stateless single-container application or as a multi-container stateful application. The following are the two images used to deploy docker-pets:

chrch/docker-pets is a front-end Python Flask container that serves up random images of housepets, depending on the given configuration
consul is a back-end KV store that stores the number of visits that the web services recieve. It's configured to bootstrap itself with 3 replicas so that we have fault tolerant persistence.
